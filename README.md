# sharkAttacks

## This project is an exercise in data cleaning with pandas in order to carry out analyses.

Using a public dataset on shark attacks around the world which has not been cleaned, I aimed to clean the data I need for different analyses. After some cleaning, I did types of analysis:

- Study the association between country, population and shark attacks. The hypothesis here is that larger countries will have a larger number of shark attacks. We are also interested in other factors that may explain amount of shark attacks, which is why we create an index of attacks per capita, and then look at the countries which have the highest amounts of attacks per capita.
- Study the lethality of shark attacks
- A first look at how the species of shark and activity could be prepared for analysis
- A first look at the association between year (time) and shark attacks. We would expect that with better reporting, and with surfing becoming more popular over time, that the amount of shark attacks goes up over time.

The main jupyter notebook uses comments and text in Markdown to walk you through the different operations, tables and plots being done and created.
